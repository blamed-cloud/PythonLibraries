# PythonLibraries
Personal collections of reusable and often needed python functions
To add them to a project, you can either download and use them,
or I also suggest trying out git submodules.

prgm_lib is a collection of mostly I/O related functions
math_lib is a collection of math related functions
... hopefully you get the idea.

also, \_\_init\_\_.py is there so that python will know this is being used as a package so you can import from this folder.
